<!-- About the web app -->

1. This web app is built to enter form data for different form types:
Personal details
Account details
Preferences

2. After entering the form data, the value is stored in the API and user is navigated to profile
page where all the form details are available

3. User can also edit the details specifically

4. The email which is registered once can not be registered again unless its deleted 
by the delete button available in the web app

5. There are validations in the form using zod library 

6. This is a responsive web app which can be used on all the screen sizes

<!-- Additional details -->

1. I have created my own APIs in the backened using node.js and the data is stored in mongoDb.
2. I have created GET, PUT, POST, DELETE req to handle the form data.
